## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SVG-sprite

#### Tools and applications

- VSCode
- Mozzila Firefox Developer
- Google Chrome

### What I learned

In this challenge my focus was on getting the quality up level. Also search a way to combine the SVG-files into one file (sprite). This minimizes the request of the page, I think.

Sample code of sprite sollution in HTML code

```html
<svg class="card__icon card__icon--sedans">
  <use href="assets/images/sprite.vg#icon-sedans"></use>
</svg>
```

### Continued development

My struggle with the first challenges was: which semantic HTML tags must I use. On [Frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) I did get some great feedback (thanks all!) on my sollutions. So I need to learn a lot more on development ðŸ˜€.

### Useful resources

- [SVG Sprite generator](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
