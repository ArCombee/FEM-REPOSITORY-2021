## Overview

### The challenge

Frontendmetor made [this](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) challenge which is rated as an <span style="color:rgb(106, 190, 205); font-weight:bold">NEWBIE</span> challenge. But for me I wasn't a walk in the park. Espacially if you try to keep the code clean and symatic. Did the research and read about the best practices in webdevelopment 2021. And yes I cheated a little bit and did not stick to all the best pratices, sorry I need more to learn I'm affraid.

### What I learned

This is my first challenge on Frontend Mentor. So I learned a lot of new stuff. I tried to code different versions, with different approches. This is the final version which I publish right now.

Later this year I will revisit the challenge an try to refactor the sollution with what I learned in later challenges.
